ABM model created from GEOG5995 practicals

My ABM is a basic model showing the interaction of agents, in this case sheep, within their environment. 
All the sheep move randomly, grazing at the environment (grass), and sharing their store (food within their stomach)
with other sheep if they are within the same neighbourhood. If they are greedy and eat too much, they will be sick! Thus reducing the
their store, whilst increasing the environment again.
